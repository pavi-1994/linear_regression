Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.
Types of linear regression:
In Linear Regression there are two types:
1.  **Simple Linear Regression** is where only one independent variable is present and the model has to find the linear relationship of it with the dependent variable
2.  **Multiple Linear Regression** there are more than one independent variables for the model to find the relationship.

**Assumptions**:
Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, and no multicollinearity between independent variables for accurate linear regression modeling.

**Evaluation Metrics**
Common evaluation metrics for regression models include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination), which measures the proportion of the variance explained by the model.
